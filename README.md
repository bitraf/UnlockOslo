# Software

* HTTP gateway with RESTful API
* Device healthcheck monitoring, accessible as HTTP GET
* Works behind NAT, on office/residential networks and 4G.
* Standard MQTT TLS communication from device to gateway. Tested with Mosquitto
* Firmware runs on standard embedded Linux, using sysfs GPIO.
Tested on Raspberry PI3 running Raspbian Jessie
* Remote access to device via reverse-tunneled SSH, for updates or debugging.
* Remote deployments to devices automated using Ansible
* Simple Python 3.5+ code for both gateway and firmware
