## Alpha

Raspberry Pi Hat for opening doors.

Design goals:

* Two high-power switches, one dedicated for the door solenoid and one extra.
* Two 24V tollerant inputs. For door sensors or other slow inputs.
* Status LEDs to make it easy to see the board's status.
* It should be easy to develop the software on the board without
  having a full setup.
