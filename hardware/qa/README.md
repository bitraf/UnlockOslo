# QA - testing and verification of Bitraf produced dlock cards.

Use the [PCB testing procedure](../README.md), and test that inputs go high when a high level is applied.

One file for each hardware version / generation of card. Log date, serial number 
(write on the card with a permanent marker that sticks), type of test (testscript) and result, comments.
